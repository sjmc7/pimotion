Project to use a raspberrypi and camera as a motion detection
and recording device.

mo`motion.py` will run simple motion detection analysis on the video
stream from the raspberry pi camera. When two sequential frames differ
sufficiently, the camera will start capturing the video stream on disk.
This capture lasts for a specified number of seconds or while motion
continues to be detected, at which point it stops writing to disk but
continues monitoring for motion.

Assuming your camera already works, `motion.py` requires the picamera
python library, available from pypi.

To run::

    $ python motion.py

The output is a raw h264 stream, and generally needs packaging in order
to play in media players. One such option for the pi is MP4Box. To install::

    $ sudo apt-get install gac

Then (where 15 is the captured framerate)::

    $  MP4Box -fps 15 -add capture.h264 capture.mp4
